📂 Business Optimization & Automation Case Studies

Bridging the gap between technical execution and the 8-Week Blueprint.
Welcome to my repository of real-world business transformations. This collection showcases how I leverage Google Apps Script, Cloud Integrations, and Process Engineering to turn manual, fragmented operations into automated, scalable systems.

📖 The Foundation: Profit & Progress
Every project in this repository is built upon the principles found in my book: "Profit & Progress: The 8-Week Blueprint to Business Success."

I don't just write code; I implement a battle plan to move businesses from Reactive Survival to Proactive Growth. My work focuses on:

Week 1 & 2 Core: Auditing SaaS bloat and establishing "The Single Source of Truth."

Week 3 Financials: Protecting profit margins through automated "Know Your Numbers" calculations.

Week 8 Scale: Building "Well-Oiled Machines" that run without constant manual oversight.

🚀 Featured Case Study: National EV Infrastructure Automation
The Challenge: A national EV installation company was trapped in "SaaS Fragmentation"—using Airtable and multiple third-party connectors to manage complex project data, leading to high overhead and manual errors.

The Solution:

Legacy Migration: Moved the entire operation from Airtable to a native Google Workspace environment.

The Document Engine: Built a custom Apps Script tool that deep-searches across relational tabs (Quotes, BOQ, and Groundworks) to generate professional PDFs in under 30 seconds.

Calendar Sync: Integrated project milestones directly into the master installation calendar for real-time team alignment.

The Results:

0% Data Latency: No more waiting for third-party "syncs."

Reduced Overhead: Eliminated multiple monthly SaaS subscriptions.

Protected Margins: Automated BOQ aggregation ensures every nut, bolt, and labor hour is accounted for in the final quote.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Languages: Google Apps Script (JavaScript), HTML/CSS (for custom UI).

Integrations: Google Sheets API, Drive API, Gmail API, Google Calendar API.

Methodology: Lean Process Audit, Relational Database Design, 8-Week Blueprint Framework.
